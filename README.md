### EPL_PlayerValue

This script was created to scrape the market value of the top 100 players of the English Premiere League 23/24 from [transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/). The data was further used to create a visualisation highlighting the market value of the players by `club` and `country`.

The `visualisation` can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/olufeyijimi.ayinde/viz/doodle/EPLPlayerMarketValue)
